; Exercise 1.44. 
;
; If f is a function and dx is some small number, then the smoothed version of 
; f is the function whose value at a point x is the average of f (x âˆ’ dx), 
; f (x), and f (x + dx). Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure 
; that computes f and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed f . It is 
; sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the 
; smoothed function, and so on) to obtained the n-fold smoothed function. Show 
; how to generate the n-fold smoothed function of any given function using smooth 
; and repeated from exercise 1.43.
