Worked Examples for SICP
========

This repository contains exercises from [The Wizard Book](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs").

The exercises are divided up into [Weekly Assignments](http://groups.google.com/group/wizardbookstudy/web/weekly-assignments).  The weekly assignments are loosely based around the [video lectures](http://www.archive.org/details/mit_ocw_sicp "Video Lectures") for this class that were originally given at MIT.

Most of the exercises have been implemented in Clojure.

I hope you find some of these examples useful.

Enjoy.
